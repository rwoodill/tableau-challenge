 Module 18

 # explanation
I tried using Tableau to save my work and unfortunately it resulted in an error every time. Instead I took some screenshots and did some work in Jupyter Notebook that I would like to share in hopes of partial marks.

# process
1. To begin, I analyzed some data from each month of 2023 to see what the data looked like and what the most popular month to ride bikes was. I determined that using the month of June would provide a reasonable amount of data for the year, as June was the most popular month. I then decided to analyze data from the years 2013, 2018, and 2023. 2013 is as far back as the data goes, so I figured it would give context to the data from 5 years later (2018) and 10 years later (2023).
2. Then it was time to clean the data.
       - I imported the files from each year and noticed that there were a fair amount of columns that I could remove. I also noticed that the data structure had changed a bit over the 10 years.
       - I updated the data from years 2013 and 2018 to match the columns of the data from 2023.
       - I removed any unnecessary columns from each dataframe.
3. I merged the three dataframes into one and exported the data.
4. Then it was time to use Tableau to create the neccessary graphs.
5. I decided to answer the prompts:
       - How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
       - By what percentage has total ridership grown?
       - How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
       - What are the top 10 stations for starting a journey?
       - What are the top 10 stations for ending a journey?
6. After completing several graphs and charts, I created a few dashboards to represent the data. Then I combined the dashboards and graphs into a final story (as shown below)

My tabs in Tableau ended looking like this:

Unfortunately when I tried to save, the process failed. I tried many times and was unable to save my final work. I redid the assignment quite a few times over the time period given and was unable to get Tableau to save my work. I ended up learning a fair bit about Tableau, but unfortunately still have no idea why it is unable to save my work. 

Thanks for reading!
